Since this interval was after World War II, this graph can be interpreted on a country basis, as the earning amounts of countries have an impact on the progress of development and the re-formation of society in many areas.\n","### At first glance, apart from the names of the categories, the prominent country names are the USA, Germany, the United Kingdom and France. It is among the top 5 countries in total numbers in the fields of Medicine, Physics, Chemistry and Economy.\n","### The fact that these countries are at the top in these matters may be due to the direct impact of the amount of immigration from around the world, especially to the USA, and the regular and open-minded education provided by the restructuring after the Second World War. His contributions to higher education and socio-cultural contributions have led to great developments in the development and progress of the whole in the fields of technology, science and economy.\n","### The top 10 in the fields of Literature and Peace has a different appearance than other branches of science. The awards received in literature include the UK, USA, France, Russia, Spain and Sweden. It can be seen that almost all of these awards received in the field of literature are from European countries and the USA is at the top due to the great immigration it received during these years.\n","### The fact that the Peace Prize has been won by many different countries can be said to have a great impact on Nobel Prizes and international political relations.
